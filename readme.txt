1--TO USE APP YOU MUST CREATE A DATABASE IN YOUR OWN SQL SERVER.
I UPLOADED AN EXAMPLE DATABASE SCRIPT AS "sql_script.sql" JUST CHANGE DATA IN IT FOR USE.
2--THERE IS NO "Resources.resx" AND "Settings.settings" FILE SO GO SOLUTION EXPLORER/
/PROPERTIES/RESOURCES(CREATE ONE) /SETTINGS(CREATE ONE)
3--GO Visual studio/solution explorer/properties/  ADD SETTINGS "connection-String-Application-("your sql connection adress" IT MUST HAVE ";TrustServerCertificate=True" AT THE END OF DATASOURCE ADDRESS ADD YOURSELF IF THERE ISN'T)"
4--ENJOY APPLICATION
